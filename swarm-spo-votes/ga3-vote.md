|Vote|âœ…YES|
|Vote Power|20.94M ADA|
|Rational|From our own position with a small pool we vote Yes, as forcing ADA to move around means there is more chance of smaller pools picking up some more ADA. But also, decentralisation may be improved by increasing the number of pools that can become sustainable. Surely some multi-poolers will split their pools and maintain their strong position, but not all will, so it is a change in the right direction. Any large pool over 50% saturation will lose delegation. Also any large pool that has committed to not pool splitting and publicly declared they will only ever run one pool will suffer from this change. This is a shame and we really empathise, but we think increasing the opportunity for more operators to become viable is the right direction|
